This course equips beginners with the foundational knowledge needed to manipulate and manage data efficiently in Python, setting them on the path to becoming proficient programmers.

## Numbers
In Python, there are several data types to represent different kinds of information. These include:

1. Integer (int) : Stores whole numbers without decimal points, such as "5 or -10".
